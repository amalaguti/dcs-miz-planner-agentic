## PyDCS: payload loader KeyError when DCS install is present

- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Symptom:** `KeyError` on a path under `S:/DCS World/.../UnitPayloads/*.lua` while creating aircraft via `Mission.flight_group_from_airport` / `Plane.__init__` → `FlyingType.load_payloads`.
- **Cause:** With a real DCS install detected, PyDCS scans payload dirs. `scan_payload_dir` skips files with no `["unitType"]` line (never caches them). `load_payloads` then does `_payload_cache[payload_path]` → KeyError. Upstream bug in PyDCS `unittype.py`; free-flight missions do not need payloads.
- **Fix / workaround:** In our compiler only, call `_disable_payload_scan(...)` before creating units: seed `_payload_cache` so the install is not scanned, and set `aircraft_type.payloads = {}` so `load_payloads` returns early. Do **not** edit files under `.venv`.
- **Code:** `src/dcs_miz_planner/compiler/pydcs_compiler.py` (`_disable_payload_scan`).
- **Do not:** Re-enable full install payload scanning without fixing the KeyError path (`.get` / skip missing keys) or pinning a fixed PyDCS.

## PyDCS: no standalone `theatre` zip member

- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Symptom:** Compiled `.miz` has `mission` / `options` / `warehouses` but no `theatre` file; theatre only appears as `["theatre"]="TheChannel"` inside `mission`.
- **Cause:** PyDCS `Mission.save` does not write a top-level `theatre` member (real ME-exported missions usually do).
- **Fix:** After `mission.save`, append a `theatre` member with the theatre id string if missing (`_ensure_theatre_member`).
- **Code:** `src/dcs_miz_planner/compiler/pydcs_compiler.py`.
- **Note:** DCS often still loads without the file; we keep it for fidelity and our compiler acceptance contract.

## PyDCS weather: `clouds_iprecptns` is an enum

- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Symptom:** `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'value'` in `Weather._make_cloud_dict` during `mission.save`.
- **Cause:** Assigning `clouds_iprecptns = 0` (int). PyDCS expects `Weather.Preceptions` (e.g. `Preceptions.None_`).
- **Fix:** Use `Weather.Preceptions.None_` (and other enum members) for clear / precip settings.
- **Code:** `PyDCSCompiler._apply_weather`.

## DCS identity strings: never invent

- **Date:** 2026-07-24 (research) / reinforced in M1
- **Symptom:** Mission fails to load or units missing if type / airfield ids are wrong.
- **Cause:** Guessing spellings (`Spitfire IX`, wrong `airdromeId`, etc.).
- **Fix:** Use verified ids only (`SpitfireLFMkIX`, Manston → `airdromeId` 5, theatre `TheChannel`, …). Prefer `reference.py` / registry over memory. Expand the registry in OpenSpec change `reference-registry-channel`, not ad-hoc in prompts.

## Mission Spec vs PyDCS boundary

- **Date:** 2026-07-25
- **Lesson:** Keep `MissionSpec` / loader / CLI free of PyDCS imports. All PyDCS usage stays behind `CompilerInterface` / `pydcs_compiler.py` so a future native compiler can replace the backend.

## OpenSpec / git process

- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Lesson:** Never implement or commit OpenSpec work on `master`/`main`. Branch name = change name. Enforced by Cursor hook `protect-master.py` and pre-commit `no-commit-to-branch`.

## How to add an entry

1. Put new lessons **at the top** of the list (newest first), under a `##` heading.
2. Prefer one concrete failure over long narrative.
3. Link the code path or OpenSpec change if it exists.
4. If the lesson changes product behavior, also update specs/design as needed — this file is not a substitute for OpenSpec.
